marker icon for the list item to center to the location and show an info window with [Yelp reviews](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation), [Street View images](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro), and [Wikipedia article images](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) for that area.
